<h2>Position and Direction</h2>
<p>In Taekwondo, we often talk about <em>where</em> a movement is - which direction it is performed in, which height section it is performed at, where one hand is in relation to the other.</p>
<p>In Korean there are a number of words which are nouns which describe various positions - such as 'the front', 'the side', 'the rear' - which can be modified to form adjectives and prepositions.</p>
